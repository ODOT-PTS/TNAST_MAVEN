Frequently Asked Questions
=========

**1. Population served, census point method rather than a block boundary method, pros/cons of method, situations with more/less distortion**

**A:** ........................<hr>
 

**2. Population served at level of service: what happens is cases where there is more than one transit stop in radius of interest? If two stops are served by the same trip is the visit only counted once for population of interest? If two stops are served by different trips (each trip visits only one stop) then are both visits counted? If the same population of interest is captured by different stop circles is population double counted?**

A: ........................<hr>

 
**3. Disaggregation of tract level data to block level data: how was this done, what are the implications in using report results?**

 A: .....................<hr>
 
 
**4. Future population projections: what is basic projection methodology, does/can methodology result in new urbanized (50k+) areas that then are taken into account for rural/urban (50k) reporting?**

A: .....................<hr>

 
**5. Distance measurements – how is service distance calculated, how accurate is it? Are there any GIS coordinate system related distortions?**
